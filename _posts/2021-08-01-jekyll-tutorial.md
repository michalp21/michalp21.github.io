## Summary
I built this blog with Jekyll, and this is a compilation of tutorials I used, along with my own notes on the steps I took. Lilian's [site](https://github.com/lilianweng/lil-log) is my inspiration. I use Github Pages to host the site, but I do use incompatible plugins.

### Prerequisites
- **Tech**: Intel macOS Big Sur[^forthis]
- **Skills**: terminal (command prompt) and git competency, basic HTML knowledge

## Jekyll Overview
What is Jekyll? This [page](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll) is a quick intro. Maybe read through it once.

I'll still try to convey the appeal of Jekyll (to me anyways). With Jekyll, I can scaffold my blog once using reusable templates, and reduce repeated content creation, like blog posts, to simple markdown files. Jekyll gives you a static site, so you don't have to worry about backends and databases and all this over-engineering, and you can host it on GitHub for free.

## Setup

Run the laptop [script](https://github.com/monfresh/laptop) to setup a Ruby environment and Jekyll. Make sure to follow the prerequisites and the install section in that tutorial. While going through those steps, rather than fixing my Homebrew I just reinstalled it fresh.

In this GitHub [tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll), follow "Creating site with Jekyll," minus prerequisites, since those were taken care of with the laptop script. This will set up a remote GitHub repo and a local repo, and set up Jekyll in the local repo. STOP before pushing to remote (unless you don't care that your barebones website will be live). At this point we can test locally.

We now see several files in our repo. Gemfile and Gemfile.lock are due to Bundler. I found this explanation about Bundler: "Bundler manages an application's dependencies through its entire life across many machines systematically and repeatably." In the Gemfile we write the gem dependencies we want to use for Ruby programs, and the autogenerated Gemfile.lock lists every dependency and version installed. More info [here](https://medium.com/never-hop-on-the-bandwagon/gemfile-and-gemfile-lock-in-ruby-65adc918b856).

Basically, run `bundle install` now, and later whenever you change the Gemfile.

To host the site locally, run `bundle exec jekyll serve`. If successful, you should be able to go to [](http://localhost:4000/)[http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in the browser and view the default Jekyll blog.

When we're ready to deploy, run `bundler exec jekyll build` to generate the site files. This is called _building_ the site (wow!) and I will refer to it as such from here on – I will not use building to mean the colloquial sense of just creating the blog.

{% include callout.html content="The following do the same thing: 'bundle' 'bundler' 'bundle install' 'bundle i'." icon="neutral"%}

## The Gemfile

The default Gemfile has good comments to help you figure things out but let's quickly run through it anyway. A gem will be listed like this: `gem "jekyll", "~> 4.2.0"` . First comes the gem name, followed by a version number.

We see a gem for the default theme, _minima_. It's pretty minimal as we will see.

Further down is a group called `:jekyll_plugins` . We should throw all our jekyll plugins in here, pretty self-explanatory.

The rest of the default Gemfile is Windows stuff.

## GitHub Pages

Since we're using GitHub Pages to host our site, it's important to know that Github Pages runs Jekyll to build the site by default, but it doesn't support most Jekyll plugins and themes. Supported themes are listed [here](https://pages.github.com/themes/), and supported plugins are listed [here](https://pages.github.com/versions/).

You have to decide whether or not to have full compatibility. I chose not to since the convenience offered by plugins outweighed the inconvenience of building my site locally. If you go to the last section of this tutorial before troubleshooting, maybe you'll share my opinion.

## The Config

The default \_config.yml stores settings used by Jekyll to build the site. These are site-wide settings, plugins, and themes. Anything defined here can be accessed as a variable in the content.

## Adding Content

A blog needs content! There's two types of content: pages and posts. Pages have no dates and are standalone, like the About page. Posts have a date, and they form the core of the blog. Some [more](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15095625/what-are-the-differences-between-a-post-and-a-page-in-jekyll) on the difference.

The posts must be stored in \_posts, found in the root directory. The posts must have the format yyyy-mm-dd-name.markdown. That is, the date in the given format followed by the name, and finally the markdown file extension.

{% include callout.html content="Note that a post's date corresponds with the date in the filename, but can be overridden by the date given in the _front matter_ of the post — more on that immediately." icon="neutral"%}

A simple post will look like this:

```markdown
---
layout: post
title: "Name"
date: 2021-07-10 14:10:58 -0700
categories: jekyll
---

This is a post. Blablablablablabla
Thank you for your time.
```

The text between the triple dashes is called the front matter, and it holds non-content like title, date, tags, etc. Content, or the actual blog text, goes below the front matter. Jekyll takes care of formatting and preparing the content for the web, leaving us to focus on the content.

The front matter is in YAML format, like the config file. The rest of the content is in markdown format. From now on, anything done in markdown is implicitly referring to the posts!

## File Organization

Markdown handles basic text formatting like italics, lists, links, and tables, but it is possible to customize the overall **style** and **structure** of the site as a whole. A theme is a drop-in solution for this.

The default theme is minima. Take a look at the minima repo [here](https://github.com/jekyll/minima).

There are several important directories here:
- \_includes: secondary templates to "plug into" other templates, or includes
- \_layouts: primary templates, or layouts
- \_posts: posts
- \_sass/minima: styling

Styling is handled by sass files in \_sass/minima and assets.

Structure is handled by [layouts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/layouts/) and [includes](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/includes/) (found in \_layouts and \_includes). In summary, both layouts and includes are templates, which are html documents with additional special syntax so they can be reused in different contexts. "Includes" are templates meant to be plugged into designated spots in another template. "Layouts" on the other hand are templates that can stand on their own.

It is important to note that template inheritance works differently than template includes. In inheritance, the parent template marks a single spot to plug in the child with the string {%raw%}`{{ content }}`{%endraw%}. The template or markdown post to be plugged in puts the parent template in the front matter, for example `layout: default`. Includes are when a template marks a specific template to be plugged in, for example {%raw%}`{% include header.html %}`{%endraw%}. The template to be plugged in does _not_ have to specify what it is being plugged into. The braces syntax is part of the Liquid template language.

Generally, keep base templates in \_layouts, and reusable components in \_includes.

## Themes

Returning to themes, while they aren't necessary I highly recommend at least using one as a base, especially if you're not super savvy with styling. Themes can also bundle together some nice features on top of a custom look and feel, like search and archiving.

To use a theme as-is, see [this guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/). Note that a gem-based theme may be incompatible with GitHub Pages. To build on a custom theme, copy the files from the theme's repo to your repository. To customize the styling, you need to write custom CSS/Sass. [This tutorial](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/07-assets/) should get you started. You should do your styling in the Sass files under \_sass.

## Kramdown

The default Markdown renderer for Jekyll is Kramdown, and the default processor is the GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) parser. It's enabled by default, and I assume it's set for the remainder of the tutorial. See the Kramdown [documentation](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html) for more info on specific functions.

## Other Features

The remaining features are optional so I'll list them alphabetically.

### Callouts

{% comment %}
\[UPDATE\]: I now use the jemoji package for emojis (see below), which simplifies things considerably. If you want full GitHub Pages compatibility though, skip this.

This is \_includes/callout.html:

{%raw%}
```markdown
<blockquote class="callout">
  <div class="flexy">
    <div class="callout-icon">{{ include.icon }}</div>
    <div class="callout-text">{{ include.content }}</div>
  </div>
</blockquote>
```
{%endraw%}

And here's a new CSS rule, in addition to the original CSS:

```css
img.emoji {
  box-shadow: none;
  margin: 0;
}
```

---
{% endcomment %}

I'm calling a callout any blockquote with an emoji to the side. I like the way Notion does it so I'm copying their look.

Unlike the clever solution with image captions (scroll down), I couldn't find a way to make callouts without using Liquid syntax in the markdown. It's not a big deal but if the markdown file is used for something else, then the Liquid probably won't be supported.

Put this in the markdown:

{%raw%}
```markdown
{% include callout.html content="Put the callout message here." icon="neutral"%}
```
{%endraw%}

The content variable is the message in the callout. The icon variable is the emoji you use for the callout. Then make a new file \_includes/callout.html:

{%raw%}
```markdown
<blockquote class="callout">
  <div class="flexy">
    {% if include.icon == "neutral" %}
      <div class="callout-icon">😐</div>
    {% elsif include.icon == "eyeroll" %}
      <div class="callout-icon">🙄</div>
    {% elsif include.icon == "browraise" %}
      <div class="callout-icon">🤨</div>
    {% else %}
      <div class="callout-icon">{{ include.icon }}</div>
    {% endif %}
    <div class="callout-text">{{ include.content }}</div>
  </div>
</blockquote>
```
{%endraw%}

Add more emojis as desired. In a scss file, style it something like so:

```css
//override blockquote left border color and padding
.callout {
  padding-left: 12px;
  border-color: grey;
}

//flex container
.flexy {
  display: flex;
}

//icon, fixed width, left flex item
.callout-icon {
  width: 30px;
  flex-shrink: 0;
}

//text, remaining width, right flex item
.callout-text {
  flex-grow: 1;
}
```

I tweaked things like padding and font size until it looked good. Note: markdown processing won't work inside callouts.

### Code

Syntax highlighting is provided in minima. Just copy the `.highlight` section from `_sass/minima/skins/classic.scss` .

When typing code, use spaces instead of tabs, or else the indent length on the site will be too large (in my opinion). In my Markdown editor, there is an option to put four spaces automatically when I hit tab.

### Comments (Disqus)

Comments would be pretty nice right? The problem is they clash with the whole static-site thing. Number one concern: where are the comments stored? You have two options:
- host your own comments
- let someone do it for you.

The first option is a pain and sort of nullifies some of Jekyll's more appealing features, like free hosting on GitHub. Now think of what actually goes into a comment system. Do users make an account to post? Can they edit and delete comments? What about threads, sorting, mentions, reactions, email notifications, and moderation?

What? Disqus does all that? For *free*? In spite of a handful of blogposts critical of ad-ridden, tracker-obsessed, privacy-trampling Disqus, that seductive string of features pulled me to the dark side. Plus there's no free, cloud-hosted alternatives as far as I know (I tried something called Social9 but it's clearly still in the works).

Just follow steps 1 and 2 of [this tutorial](https://jreel.github.io/setting-up-disqus-comments-on-jekyll/). If you used the minima theme as a base like I did, then you should already have Disqus boilerplate code. Otherwise finish the tutorial. Note that you won't be able to see the comments when testing locally.

We're not done yet. We can turn off some ads in the Disqus dashboard. See the images:

![adsettings.png]{: width="600"}

![advancedsettings.png]{: width="600"}

### Excerpts

If we want to add post excerpts, add `excerpt_separator: <!--more-->` to _config.yaml. The excerpt in each post will go from the beginning to the excerpt separator. Add `<!--more-->` to each post at the desired end of the excerpt.

{% include callout.html content="'excerpt_separator: <!--more-->' can also be added per post in the front matter but you have to be more careful about using the separator in the main page (index.html or similar)" icon="neutral"%}

I like the idea from Lil'log of blockquote summaries as the excerpts, so I stole it.

### Fonts

Clarification on terms:

-   Typeface: Visual design of the symbols (what you see)
-   Font: Implementation of the symbols (what you use)
-   Style: Single typeface, e.g. bold
-   Family: Complete set of styles

[More info](https://web.dev/variable-fonts/)

Go to [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), find a nice font family, select the desired styles (or create your own if it's a variable font), (optionally at this stage, click the icon in the top right to open a sidebar, if it doesn't happen automatically), from the sidebar select "@import", copy the text INSIDE the style tags, and paste it in one of the scss files in \_sass. Here's a picture of the sidebar:

![font.png]{: width="250"}
*I dare you to use this font on your site.*

Last step is to actually use it. For example, if we're following closely to the minima styling files, we might see `$$base-font-family: "Your Old Font", "Helvetica Neue", "Times New Roman", serif !default;`. Replace the first option with the name of the font family we just imported.

{% include callout.html content="Some fonts will break LaTeX. See the LaTeX section." icon="neutral"%}

### Footnotes
Footnotes are supported by Kramdown! See this [SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/48250535) for how to use them and about compatibility.

To write multi-line footnotes, indent the paragraphs after the first one. This allows you to add LaTeX math blocks in the footnotes, in addition to inline math.

Although I ended up not using a footnotes title, here's how I did it when I had one:

```css
.footnotes::before {
  display: block;
  content: "Footnotes:";
}
```

### Images

Images are added like this in markdown:

```markdown
![alt_text](/assets/images/image.png)
```

You can also separate the path from the rest like so:

```markdown
![alt_text]
...
[alt_text]: /assets/images/image.png
```

It didn't work for me without the first forward slash in the link (before "assets").

To fix the size of the image, add some CSS:

```markdown
![alt_text](/assets/images/image.png){: width="500"}

OR

![alt_text]{: width="500"}
...
[alt_text]: /assets/images/image.png
```

You can also add a CSS class instead, and style it separately.

### Image Captions

Want to have image captions but don't want to pollute your markdown files with specialized Liquid syntax? You've come to the right place :)

Use this in markdown:

```markdown
![alt_text](path_to_image)
*image_caption*
```

Then use this in Sass:

```css
img + em {
  display: block;
  text-align: center;
}
```

This selects the first em element after an img. When the above markdown is processed it will generate an img followed by an em as desired.

Source: this [SO thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19331362/using-an-image-caption-in-markdown-jekyll).

### LaTeX

There are many outdated tutorials for LaTeX out there, so don't follow them!

In includes/head.html (or somewhere in the head section of your site), add the import script:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" id="MathJax-script" async
  src="<https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js>">
</script>
```

Notice we are using mathjax 3, which is faster than mathjax 2. Notice we are not using the mathjax cdn ([cdn.mathjax.org](http://cdn.mathjax.org)) since it was [shut down](https://www.mathjax.org/cdn-shutting-down/). It may still work due to a redirect to [cdnjs.cloudflare.com](http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com). We use jsdelivr instead. Finally, be sure to use https instead of http or mathjax may be blocked for security reasons.

There's a few [differences](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/input/tex/differences.html) from real LaTeX, but most importantly, only the math mode is implemented (with the exception of `\ref` and `\eqref`); the text mode from LaTeX is replaced by markdown/HTML. Additionally, by default, both inline and block LaTeX expressions are signified by double dollar signs: e.g. `$$y=x^2$$`. Instead of using dedicated syntax, block expressions have to be separated from surrounding text by a newline on each side.

See the [documentation](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/web/configuration.html) to configure mathjax (it's different from mathjax 2!) In short, just add a global object called `MathJax` in a `<script>` tag before the import script.

Random note 1: if you want to type a vertical bar in inline LaTeX, use `\vert`, because otherwise kramdown might think it's the start of a table.

Random note 2: If you use a font called Crimson Text (and possibly other fonts), from Google Fonts, the LaTeX expressions may be too small on Firefox. If you use mathjax 2 for whatever reason, see [here](https://groups.google.com/g/mathjax-users/c/v3W-daBz87k/m/xjxFFdfQBQAJ) for an explanation and two possible fixes. Those solutions did not work for me with mathjax 3, so I just switched to a different font.

### LaTeX: Automatic Equation Numbering

Add automatic equation numbering for LaTeX in the MathJax configuration. 

```html
<script>
MathJax = {
    window.MathJax = {
        tex: {
            tags: 'ams'
        }
    };
};
</script>
```

Then in a compatible environment, add a label:

```markdown
$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{s_o} + \frac{1}{s_i} = \frac{1}{f} \label{eq:glf}
\end{equation}
$$
```

Finally, reference it:

```markdown
Blablabla look at this cool formula \eqref\eqref{eq:glf}.
```

### Links

Links are added like this in markdown:

```markdown
[link text](http://www.example.com)
```

You can also separate the path from the rest like so:

```markdown
[reference style link][linkid]
...
[linkid]: http://www.example.com/ "Optional Title"
```

The "reference style link" text should be replaced by your own text.

An **internal link**, or a link to another post on your site, looks like this:

{%raw%}
```markdown
[link text]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2021-07-19-post %})
```
{%endraw%}

What comes after `post_url`  is the name of the post file, without the file extension (typically `.md`).

Note: In Jekyll 4 you don't need to put the {%raw%}`{{site.baseurl}}`{%endraw%} part; see the [documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/tags/#links).

### Links to Headers

If a header on a page has a CSS id on it, you can link to it directly (when the reader goes to the page it will scroll directly to that header). If you know the id, just add it to the URL in your link after a `#` symbol. Here's two examples, one for an external link and one for an internal one.

{%raw%}
```markdown
[link text](http://www.example.com#the-header)
[link text]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2021-07-19-post %}#the-header)
```
{%endraw%}

So how do you find the header id? External websites may have a link icon next to each header with the direct URL. If not, you might still find ids with inspect element. For internal links, it's possible to autogenerate header ids, which are formatted as the header name, but lowercased and connected by dashes. So `The Header` turns into `the-header`.

### Pagination

Pagination is supported. Modify the Gemfile like so:

```markdown
group :jekyll_plugins do
	gem "jekyll-paginate"
	...
```

Modify the _config.yaml like so:

```markdown
plugins:
  - jekyll-paginate
	...

paginate: 10
```

The number after `paginate` is the max number of posts per page.

Run `bundler` to install.

Now to implement the pagination in the site files. jekyll-paginate only works on index.html. In particular, the default jekyll project uses an [index.md](http://index.md) which extends an html template, but that won't work. After appropriate refactoring (using an index.html), replace all mention of `site.posts` with `paginator.posts`. Finally, add this blob towards the bottom to add page navigation buttons.

{%raw%}
```markdown
{% if paginator.total_pages > 1 %}
  <div class="pagination">
    {% if paginator.previous_page %}
      <a class="ml-1 mr-1" href="{{ paginator.previous_page_path | prepend: site.baseurl | replace: '//', '/' }}">&laquo; Prev</a>
    {% else %}
      <span>&laquo; Prev</span>
    {% endif %}
    {% for page in (1..paginator.total_pages) %}
      {% if page == paginator.page %}
        <span class="ml-1 mr-1">{{ page }}</span>
      {% elsif page == 1 %}
        <a class="ml-1 mr-1" href="{{ paginator.previous_page_path | prepend: site.baseurl | replace: '//', '/' }}">{{ page }}</a>
      {% else %}
        <a class="ml-1 mr-1" href="{{ site.paginate_path | prepend: site.baseurl | replace: '//', '/' | replace: ':num', page }}">{{ page }}</a>
      {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
    {% if paginator.next_page %}
      <a class="ml-1 mr-1" href="{{ paginator.next_page_path | prepend: site.baseurl | replace: '//', '/' }}">Next &raquo;</a>
    {% else %}
      <span>Next &raquo;</span>
    {% endif %}
  </div>
{% endif %}
```
{%endraw%}

There is a more sophisticated pagination package [here](https://github.com/sverrirs/jekyll-paginate-v2), but it is not supported by GitHub Pages. I decided I didn't need it.

### References

I moved the full references tutorial to a [separate post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2021-08-06-bibtex-jekyll %}).

### Table of Contents
Plop this in your markdown.

{%raw%}
```markdown
- TOC
{:toc}
```
{%endraw%}

It will be replaced by an list of all your headers, with indentation.

Here are some [kramdown settings](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/converter/html.html#toc) affecting table of contents, which you can set in \_config.yml.

### Tags

Tags are supported in Jekyll. Just list tags separated by spaces in the front matter of the corresponding post. Unfortunately that's pretty much it. There are packages to view a page of tags, or list posts by tag, but they are not supported by GitHub Pages. I'd have to implement that functionality myself.

Someone did just that in [this tutorial](https://longqian.me/2017/02/09/github-jekyll-tag/). With this approach, the markdown files in the tag folder must be generated for every new tag (even if automated with the given Python script).

That felt like complete crap so I turned to [jekyll-archives](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-archives) (before this I was fully compatible with GitHub Pages, this was the breaking point for me haha). It also handles categories and archives. The only problem is the added burden of building the site on my own before pushing to GitHub, but if tag generation is not completely smooth it's not worth sticking so fiercely to GitHub Pages.

To have a dedicated page to display all your tags, make a tags.html with something like this in it:

{%raw%}
```html
---
layout: default
---
<div class="home other-pages">
  <h1 class="page-heading">Tags</h1>
  {% capture temp_tags %}
    {% for tag in site.tags %}
      {{ tag[1].size | plus: 1000 }}#{{ tag[0] }}#{{ tag[1].size }}
    {% endfor %}
  {% endcapture %}
  {% assign sorted_temp_tags = temp_tags | split:' ' | sort %}
  {% for temp_tag in sorted_temp_tags %}
    {% assign tag_items = temp_tag | split: '#' %}
    <span class="post-meta">
      <a class="post-tag" href="/tag/{{ tag_items[1] }}">{{ tag_items[1]}} ({{ tag_items[2] }})</a>
    </span><br/>
  {% endfor %}
</div>
```
{%endraw%}

Similar things can be done for categories and archives.

## Publishing the Site

Done? Time to publish! Remember we used custom plugins, so we can't push to GitHub and let it build our site for us. Now at this stage people will say you need to build the site yourself, then move it to another branch called gh-pages, then push that to GitHub Pages, and since it is _such_ a burden, they will then promote their GitHub Actions and Travis CIs.

Here's what you do. Check you are on master or main branch (I haven't checked if any arbitrary branch will work). Wrap up your changes and git commits. Now add `destination: docs` to \_config.yml to change the destination of the static site generated by Jekyll from \_site to docs. Now run `bundler exec jekyll build` to build the site. Also in terminal, run `touch .nojekyll` . This is a file which tells GitHub not to run Jekyll on your files because you already did that. Now commit .nojekyll and docs, and push to GitHub. Finally, in GitHub, go to Settings > Pages > Source and change the root folder to docs. There may be some benefit to using separate branches instead of a docs folder in the same branch, but it's just a personal site so I doubt it matters.

From now on, just build before pushing.[^tried]

Assuming you are making a user site and you have not set a baseurl in \_config.yml, you should be able to go to username.github.io and view your blog![^otherwise] Congratulations!

## Misc. Troubleshooting

I tried to keep troubleshooting to each specific section above, but here's some extras. In general, if things are misbehaving, be sure to check for any error messages in the terminal first. They're pretty descriptive.

### Changes not visible
This class of issues is fixed by having at least a double digit IQ.
- If changes were made to \_config.yaml, the site has to be relaunched.
- If changes were made to styling, make sure it is being imported all the way through to assets/css/main.css.
- Your styling code could just be wrong.
- You think you're editing/replacing one file but you're changing another one. Or you think you're refreshing the post you edited but you're not. Or you think you're refreshing the local testing site but you're refreshing the production site.

### 404 Error

Annoying and frequent mistake: even if the code is automatically reloaded upon changes, if you just refresh your page you may reload a dead link so check the URL.

Another possibility is that title or category has changed. If so go back to `localhost:4000`, *reload*, and navigate to the desired page. This happened to me on Safari.

### Bundle Install Fails

I remember having to delete the Gemfile.lock file to get my gems to install one time. I think it's no big deal if you're working solo but I'm not that knowledgeable about it so take it with a grain of salt.

### Browser Problems

Firefox messed me up with the fonts at least, but browser compatibility could come into play with other things too. Try different browsers. This applies mostly to display oddities.

[^forthis]: These are what I used so I can say with some confidence that you too can get a working solution with them. Alternatives may also work though.
[^tried]: I tested this with a main branch and a user site. I haven't tried other branches, or project or organization sites. It seems the only acceptable folders are . (root) and ./docs.

	<p>I'm Michal, welcome to my (new) site. I plan to be pretty flexible on topics, but my interests generally lie in computer science and AI. I view this as my public notes.</p>

	<p>The style of this blog is based on <a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log">Lil'log</a>, an excellent deep learning blog.</p>
